1 hour later I managed to add the [https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman](cayman theme) to the page. <!--more-->It looks much better now. It took quite a while because it took me a while to realize I only needed to add the Gemfile with the theme dependency. I tried use *jekyll new* but it didn't really help.

Next time I have to create a jekyll blog will start with the correct theme from the beginning.
